ParkEZ: Parking made easy 

Automation is the 21st centuryâ€™s most cliched buzzword. 
However, most people mistake automation for throwing computing power and resources at solving problems - int the face of simpler, more intuitive solutions. 

A simple solution to eliminate the parking woes the great country of India faces today - an automated parking solution which involves minimal hardware complexity to implement. 

Technologies used: 
- MongoDB to store parking related information
- React Native for the user app (iOS and Android both versions are being worked on) 
- Express.js and Node for creating the API endpoints for the app 
- Arduino to fetch data from ultrasonic sensors for smart parking 
- NodeMCU with Adafruit API to interface the data coming from Arduino, and sending/receiving queries from the server
